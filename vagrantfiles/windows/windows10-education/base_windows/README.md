# Description
Base Windows 10 Education machine using a custom base box with no hardening provisioning.

The base box this machine uses has been generated with a Windows 10 Education version 21H2 ISO that the University of Oviedo makes available for its students. Thus, we can make sure we use an official and clean version of the operating system that might be used in the education environment where the machines could potentially be deployed.

# Additional software included
The machine has CLARA already available to be able to test the system's compliance.
